# No-Nmap
#What You Do When There Is No Network Scanner in Shell.
# 🔍 2-Liner TCP Port Scanners in Bash, Netcat, and Python

This repository contains a collection of simple **2-liner Bash scripts** for basic **TCP port scanning** using `/dev/tcp`. These scanners are great for quick enumeration, learning, or scripting during CTFs or pentesting engagements.

> ⚠️ These are basic linear scanners with no stealth, parallelism, or UDP support. For more advanced scanning, use tools like `nmap`, `masscan`, or `rustscan`.
